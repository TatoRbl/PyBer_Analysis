# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

We need to get the most info with our database, so we also need to see the data by kind of cities like Urban, suburban & rurals.

![PyBer_fare_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108448459/188351933-5de1d23e-b243-48e4-9bc1-0ab6b8dfb11d.jpg)

In the Pyber_fare_summary we can see how the Urban cities have the higher total fares vs suburban & rurals
but when wee look the average fare per ride, and the average fares per driver we can se that the higher fare is indeed in rural cities.
The rural cities have less drivers than urban cities, so if in rural cities have less drivers and hifer fre per ride, the fares per driver will be the highest.
So we have a lot of discrepancy in our kind of cities.

We must promote more drivers in rural cities.
We must normalize the fares in all cities
We must promote more rides to clients in rural cities
